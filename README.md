# Auto-Yahtzee

I would like to make an object detection program that reads a roll of 5 dice. The program will then decide what the best yahtzee move is and keep score. This could be wrapped up in a flask app with a nice looking scoreboard and employed onto a raspberry pi so that game can be played naturally. This is the easiest implementation of object detection that I can think of where I can interact with the program. Data sets are abundant for dice images. One example is here: https://www.kaggle.com/koryakinp/d6-dices-images
